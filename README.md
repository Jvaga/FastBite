FastBite

This project is a web application for a fast food restaurant built using React, TypeScript, SCSS for styling, Context for state management, and Framer Motion for animations.

The website provides users with a intuitive interface to explore the restaurant's menu, place orders, and learn more about the restaurant's offerings. Leveraging React and TypeScript ensures a robust and maintainable codebase, while SCSS allows for efficient styling with reusable components. The Context is employed for managing global state, providing a seamless experience across different parts of the application.
